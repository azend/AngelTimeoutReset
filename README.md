ANGEL Timeout Reset
===================

ANGEL Timeout Reset is a Chrome extension which automatically keeps your ANGEL session alive while browsing the site.

How does it work?
-----------------

This plugin works by opening the ANGEL profile page in a hidden iframe and then closing it on regular intervals to negate the auto timeout that ANGEL enforces. This means that you can stay logged in almost indefinately without having to touch the page.

### That's stupid! Why are you using an iframe? You should have used XHR!
I could have. I didn't. Too bad. Deal with it.
